 @blog-post["Day 6 7/29/19"]{
  I refreshed my memory on how to update my blog and push and pull. }

 @blog-post["Tickets and 2htdp/image - 7/16/19"]{
  "Today we worked in the office, seperating into two groups, one group with those more experienced in computer science,and the other not being as much.
  This has taught me the type of dynamic that compute scientists usually have to work under in the workplace. The senior interns
  created tickets and sent them to us in order to solve these problems.}

 @blog-post["Tickets and 2htdp/universe - 7/17/19"]{
  "We continued to use 2htdp/image and later in the day expanded into 2htdp/universe. Reading the documentation, although difficult
  to read at some times, was very useful and interesting to learn about. Learning all of the different parts of universe was very
  informative"}

 @blog-post["Coding  as a group - 7/18/19"]{
  "Today we started out with just one object on our computer and proceeded to pass it around in our groups and added different
  things to each computers code. This resulted in a variety of different shapes and figures and showed new and unique ways
  that I could use 2htdp/image and universe that I had not known how to do before. Seeing everyones code also showed me how
  everyone has a different style of coding and that sometimes it's not easy to read other peoples code if you don't know the
  reasoning behind it."}

 @blog-post["Tickets - 7/19/19"]{
  "Today we worked on tickets, and I interacted with the senior interns as they helped me on parts of the ticket that I didn't
  understand. It was very insightful as I learned the difference between the senior interns and the junior interns because of the
  gap in skill between us."}

 @blog-post["Kata Collections - 7/29/19"]{
  "Today we paired up and then decided what part of the Kata Collection that we wanted to do. 3 of the pairs decided to do my-data-scis and so we all
  sat together and worked on it together. I had one computer that didn't work, and on the next, it took a lot of work to get git to work, but once I
  did get it to work, it was smooth sailing from there. My task was to add stimuli to the my-data-sci katas and I managed to do that, but not before
  running into problem with pushing. With my peers as well as Stephen's help, I was able to get it to work. Today I realized how much easier it is to
  solve technical problems when I have the help of my peers to help me."
 }

 @blog-post["More Data Sci and Coding Interview - 7/30/19"]{
  "Stephen lectured on what we should expect from a coding interview and although I didn't really understand the coding problems that
  I might have to do, the information that I received was very useful. After that we continued to work on data sci katas and we completed
  all of the stimuli for the data sci katas that were there. After finishing that, we moved on to creating more data sci katas from the
  plot documentation. In the last half hour, I watched Drew solve a mock coding interview problem, and since he was coding in C, I didn't
  understand most of it, but I recognized some things that were similar to Java such as the for loops. With the mock question, I realized
  how much more I had to learn as Drew was at a level far above my own."
 }
 @blog-post["Interview Questions and Data Sci cont. - 7/31/19"]{
 "Today was basically the same as yesterday. I saw the linked list problem solved again, but this time solved in C++ and Psuedo code. For
  the Data Sci Katas, I reorganized them so that all of the problems that involved math I created a subgroup called Data Manipulation
  and moved all of the katas into there. I will not be able to attend tomorrow, so there will be a missing entry and my blog will resume
  August 2nd. "
}
  @blog-post["AMA and Data sci cont. - 8/2/19"]{
  "Stephen had an AMA today, and I learned a lot about how the industry works, and I learned a lot. We finished up the data sci katas
  and that was about all we did since we had a short day today."
