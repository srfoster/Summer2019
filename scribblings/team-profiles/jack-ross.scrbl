  We had a fascinating introduction to github and working with the terminal. We first created our bios and pushed them to
  the repository. We spent the rest of the day organizing and editing fundamental katas. I also had a great sandwich from
  Judy's Cafe.

  Jason taught us how to revert commits. We pushed dummy texts to the repo and then reverted them. We familiarized
  ourselves with 2htdp. I created an image of Mike Wazowski and added it to my bio (pictured above).

  I created three katas (in fundamentals) for the rotate function, each with a different level of difficulty. The easiest kata is to rotate
  a green ellipse by 45 degrees. The medium kata challenges the programmer to define a function that rotates a red square
  by x degrees. The most difficult kata requires the programmer input an angle in radians and then define functions to
  converts radians to degrees and rotate text by that amount.

 @blog-post["Day 19"]{
  We played around more with 2htdp and created katas using overlay, offset, and superimpose functions. I worked with
  2htdp/universe in the afternoon and created a kata of an animated ball that could be controlled with the arrow keys.
  I also spent the afternoon learning how to use the map, apply, curry, compose, and shuffle functions on racket,
  as well as creating lambda functions.
                      }

 @blog-post["Day 20"]{
  I organized and edited all of the 'medium' katas from the 'kata b' file (the katas made in the previous week). I added
  them to the examples.rkt file, organized them into a subcollection, and pushed them to the repository.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 21"]{
  We worked with Jason in the game engine. After scrolling through some of the files (and thousands of lines of code),
  we began to edit the game engine (on our own branch, of course) to change features. For example, I changed the default
  red dot to my 2htdp Mike Wazowski character that I made earlier in the week. We also changed the default settings of
  custom-enemy and custom-coin. I also created a function so that gets the playerposition and restricts movement so that
  the player cannot move off the screen.
 }

 
 @blog-post["Day 26"]{
  I added descriptions to master-doc in the morning. In the afternoon, we went through some of the unorganized katas
  in new-katas-b and new-katas-070819 and moved them to the correct folders.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 27"]{
  We created pokeball animation katas and organized them into a subcollection. We also worked with Daniel and Michael on
  creating a new system for organizing and rendering all of the fundamental katas in my-fundamentals-katas/katas.rkt and
  my-fundamentals-katas/rendering.rkt.

  Katie and I started working on creating a diagram to map the dependencies of all the files in the repo. We first had to
  figure out how to create diagrams on racket. We worked with pin-arrow-line on pict to create a function that would take
  in n elements and organize them into a diagram with arrows. We've gotten very far with coding it, but we will have to
  finish tomorrow.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 29"]{
  Katie and I finished the diagram function (with much help from Stephen). We spent the rest of the day mapping the
  file dependencies on paper and will continue to work on it tomorrow. We may not have time to make the electronic diagram--
  it will probably require more work in future weeks.

  Katie and I finished out 'prototype diagram' which connects most of the dependencies of the main files in the repo. We
  it and placed the file in the Git-Workflow-Help folder. It still needs a lot of work, though, and I hope to continue this
  project when I return in two weeks' time. There are a lot more files that need to be added and I want to build more
  functions to simplify the building.

 @blog-post["Day 31"]{
  I am working wth Daniel and Kristyna on making and organizing GIF katas. There aren't really enough things we can do with
  GIFS alone, so we added them to the memes katas; we eventually need to delete the GIFs folder because it's redundant now.
  I added pretty basic nyan cat gifs to the katas as well.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 32"]{
  I spent most of the day the day fixing a bunch of errors in the my-memes-lang folder. There were some images and GIFs that
  were in the wrong places and another problem with merging issues. I also added two meme katas to our collection in
  examples.rkt.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 33"]{
  We didn't have wifi at the library today (until the very end), so we spent most of the day doing problems from the "Cracking
  Coding Interview" book, learning better techniques in recursion and using map/apply effectively.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 34"]{
  We spent the first half of the day doing problems from the Coding Interview book. I spent the rest of the day workin on
  tickets in the memes and GIFs katas: adding and editing new katas, fixing errors, and organizing the sub-collections so
  that they render correctly.
 }

 @blog-post["Day 35"]{
  It was the last day for many of the interns. We started off by reading Paul Graham's article "Beating the Averages".
  We talked about the article and sorted high-level languages into three rankings: without garbage compilers (C/C++),
  with garbage compilers (Java/Python), and with garbage compilers plus macros (Lisp/Racket). We then created two basic
  macros in Racket involving the define function. I spent the rest of the day working on coding challenges that Stephen
  put on the board and fixing file organization errors. Thank you for a great summer, Stephen!
