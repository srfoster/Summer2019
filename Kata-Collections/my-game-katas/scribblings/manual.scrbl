@title{Game Katas}

These step-by-step kata sets teach how to use the 2htdp/universe library.
Progressing through each set is meant to become progressively harder, each kata teaching a different concept and guiding the user
in creating a different part until the user has built a finished product. 

All katas in this folder aim to teach game-like interaction alongside animation.

- Plane Game (un-finished) provides katas to create a simple game in which a user-controlled plane shoots bullets.

- Googly Eyes provides katas to create an interactive eye.

- Art Games provides katas to create a drawing game using the mouse.

- Rectangle Games teaches various, important animation concepts using rectangles for maximum simplicity.

- Snake Game provides katas to create the classic Snake game, where the user controls a snake to move around the screen and eat food, which grows the snake.
Meanwhile, the user must make sure that the snake does not run into itself. NOTE: More Katas are needed! (Check issue #561 on Github)
